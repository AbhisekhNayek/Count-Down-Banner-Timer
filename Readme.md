# 🎉 Countdown Banner Application

Welcome to the **Countdown Banner Application**! 🚀 This project is a full-stack web application that allows you to create and manage banners with countdown timers. The banners automatically disappear when the countdown reaches zero, and you can toggle their visibility as needed.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

This project is divided into two main parts: **Backend** and **Frontend**.

### Backend

- **`config`**: Contains database configuration files (`db.js`).
- **`models`**: Includes the MongoDB schema definitions (`Banner.js`).
- **`routes`**: Holds the API route handlers (`banner.js`).
- **`server.js`**: The entry point for the Express server, setting up and starting the backend.

### Frontend

- **`components`**: Contains React components and their styles:
  - `Banner.jsx` & `Banner.css`: Main banner component.
  - `Content.jsx` & `Content.css`: Content display component.
  - `Dashboard.jsx` & `Dashboard.css`: Dashboard interface for managing banners.
- **`src`**: Main React application files.
  - `App.js` & `App.css`: Main application component.
  - `index.js`: Entry point for rendering the React app.
